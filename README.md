In this project, we will be using data science techniques to perform sentimental analysis on tweets. Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms where users express their opinions and feelings on a wide range of topics.Our goal in this project is to build a predictive 
model that can accurately classify tweets as positive, negative or neutral. We will be using text data from tweets tweets are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis. These data are useful in understanding the opinion of the people about a variety of 
topics. Therefore, we need to develop an Automated Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis Model in-order to compute the customer perception.


************METHODOLOGY************
• Data Scraping : Scrap the necessary data from twitter using twitter search scraper library, including id, 
content, username, date reply, like and retweet.
• Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the collected data by removing punctuations, stop words, hashtags, 
formating the data to confirm that it is ready for analysis.
• Data Exploration and Visualization: Data exploration is the process of analyzing and understanding the 
structure and characteristics of a dataset. It involves examining the dataset to identify patterns, 
relationships.
• Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning model for the predict result. Consider 
different types of models, including support vector machine(SVM), linear regression, naïve bayes, logistic 
regression.
• Model Training: Fit the chosen model to a training dataset using the features selected during the feature 
engineering phase.
• Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on a testing dataset. Use appropriate 
evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess the model’s performance.
• Prediction: Use the best accuracy model to make prediction about product review .
• Conclusion: Evaluate the prediction outcomes and derive conclusions regarding the performance of the 
model. Offer suggestions for enhancing the model and its application in the future based on the 
findings.
